My test case in speedup/1:
N = 4
C = counts([2, 3, 3, 1],
           [2, 1, 2, 4],
           [2, 1, 3, 2],
           [1, 2, 2, 3])
T is unknown.

The result ratio (plain_tower / tower) is 31.0

One ambiguous puzzle found:
C = counts([4,2,3,2,1],[1,3,2,3,2],[5,3,2,3,1],[1,2,3,2,2])
T1 = [[1,2,3,4,5],[2,1,4,5,3],[4,5,2,3,1],[3,4,5,1,2],[5,3,1,2,4]]
T2 = [[1,2,3,4,5],[3,1,4,5,2],[4,5,2,3,1],[2,4,5,1,3],[5,3,1,2,4]]
